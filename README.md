# Project Status: In Progress

This project is currently under active development.
I am building and refining a scalable securities pricing data pipeline using Docker, Airflow, Snowflake, and AWS. The repository will be updated continuously as new components are implemented, including:
Data ingestion and orchestration workflows
Pricing data transformations
Data quality checks and monitoring
Scalable storage and querying in Snowflake
Infrastructure and containerization improvements
Please note that some features, documentation, and pipeline components may be incomplete or evolving.
This repository reflects my real-time engineering process and will showcase the full end-to-end pipeline once development is complete
