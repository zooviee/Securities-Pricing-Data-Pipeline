# Project Status: In Progress

This project is currently under active development.<br>
I am building and refining a scalable securities pricing data pipeline using Docker, Airflow, Snowflake, and AWS. The repository will be updated continuously as new components are implemented, including:<br>
- Data ingestion and orchestration workflows
- Pricing data transformations
- Data quality checks and monitoring
- Scalable storage and querying in Snowflake
- Infrastructure and containerization improvements<br>
Please note that some features, documentation, and pipeline components may be incomplete or evolving.<br>
This repository reflects my real-time engineering process and will showcase the full end-to-end pipeline once development is complete<br>
